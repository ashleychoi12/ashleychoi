     <p id="about">
     Hello! My name is Ashley Choi, and I'm Korean. I watch a lot of movies because that is a huge hobby of mine. I watch a whole variety from documentaries to science fiction. I have two dogs named Coco and Chanel who both love to sleep! My favorite food is ramen noodles, and my favorite movie snack is Crawly Gummy Worms. I have lived in New Jersey my whole life, but one day I would like to get out of here and explore the world! I like hanging out with my friends, and just eating food with them! I am still a high school student, but outside of school I like to snowboard, ice skate, and play the clarinet.
